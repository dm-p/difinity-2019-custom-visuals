# Hi There!

This repository is to support the presentation given at Difinity 2019, entitled *Power BI Custom Visuals: Getting Beyond the Boilerplate*.

Each tag represents a specific step in the tutorial and can be reconciled against the [PDF copy of the presentation](https://github.com/dm-p/difinity-2019-custom-visuals/blob/master/presentation/Power%20BI%20Custom%20Visuals%20-%20Getting%20Beyond%20the%20Boilerplate%20-%20Difinity%202019-02-20.pdf), also present in this repository's `presentation` subfolder.

You will need access to the [Power BI Custom Visuals SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-visuals/docs/step-by-step-lab/developing-a-power-bi-custom-visual/). Refer here for instructions on setting up the toolchain, certificate and developer visual. You can then run `npm i` to update your packages and then get started.

Enjoy!
