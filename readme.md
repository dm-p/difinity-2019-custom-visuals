# Hi There!

This repository is to support the presentation given at Difinity 2019, entitled *Power BI Custom Visuals: Getting Beyond the Boilerplate*.

Each tag represents a specific step in the tutorial and can be reconciled against the PDF copy of the presentation, also present in this repository's `presentation` subfolder.

You will need access to the Power BI Custom Visuals SDK. Refer here for instructions on setting up the toolchain, certificate and developer visual. You can then run `npm i` to update your packages and then get started.

Enjoy!

Daniel Marsh-Patrick
